Description: Squarez puzzle game server
 This is a remake of the Squarez game by Eric Burgess
 .
 You are presented a 8x8 grid of 3 different symbols and a timer, 
 Selecting 4 identical elements forming the edges of the square
 remove the edges, refill the timer and give you points. The bigger
 the square is, the more time and points you will get. Squares that
 are not horizontal or 45Â° have bonus point and time.
 .
