Squarez puzzle game

This is a remake of the Squarez game by Eric Burgess

You are presented a 8x8 grid of 3 different symbols and a timer, 
Selecting 4 identical elements forming the edges of the square
remove the edges, refill the timer and give you points. The bigger
the square is, the more time and points you will get. Squares that
are not horizontal or 45Â° have bonus point and time.

# Building the game
By default, everything except the web client is built; to build only
some part of squarez, use the following cmake options:

BUILD_TEST        to build a test program
BUILD_QML_CLIENT  to build the desktop client (requires Qt5)
BUILD_SERVER      to build the server (requires fastcgi++, boost)
ENABLE_SYSTEMD    to enable systemd support in the server (requires systemd)

## HTML version
An HTML/javascript version of the game can be compled using emscripten.

Run:
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/lib/emscripten/cmake/Modules/Platform/Emscripten.cmake

Assuming the emscripten root is /usr/lib/emscripten

## Server for multiplayer mode
The multiplayer mode requires a server, which is a fastcgi binary:
File is squarezd and requires a --port argument, the http server must
route all request under squarez/ to the squarezd server
