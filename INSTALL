# Building the game
By default, everything except the web client is built; to build only
some part of squarez, use the following cmake options:

BUILD_TEST        to build a test program
BUILD_QML_CLIENT  to build the desktop client (requires Qt5)
BUILD_SERVER      to build the server (requires fastcgi++, boost)
ENABLE_SYSTEMD    to enable systemd support in the server (requires systemd)

## HTML version
An HTML/javascript version of the game can be compled using emscripten.

Run:
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/usr/lib/emscripten/cmake/Modules/Platform/Emscripten.cmake

Assuming the emscripten root is /usr/lib/emscripten

## Server for multiplayer mode
The multiplayer mode requires a server, which is a fastcgi binary:
File is squarezd and requires a --port argument, the http server must
route all request under squarez/ to the squarezd server
